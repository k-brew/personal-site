## Hello!

You've caught me in the middle of constructing this page, sorry for the current lack-of-content.

Please check these links for some more information/content in the meantime until I have this page properly developed:

- [Old Personal Site](https://kyle-brewster.blogspot.com/)
- [Github](https://github.com/k-brew)
- [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-brewster)

In the future, this page will be the "landing page" for a collection of my websites (or maybe branches within the same site). In the near future, there will be the following topics:

1. **Professional/portfolio** - a collection of work samples and experience that potential employers would find relevent
2. **Personal** - a platform for voicing my ideas, sharing things that I find interesting, and other things
3. **Learning** - a collection of my notes and resources I find helpful/informative
4. *to be announced soon*

Best wishes in the meantime,  
Kyle
