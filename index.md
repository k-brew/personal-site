## Hello!

You've caught me in the middle of constructing this page, sorry for the current lack-of-content.

Please check these links for some more information/content in the meantime until I have this page properly updated:

- [Old Personal Site](https://kyle-brewster.blogspot.com/)
- [Github](https://github.com/k-brew)
- [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-brewster)

Many more changes to come soon!

Best wishes in the meantime,  
Kyle
